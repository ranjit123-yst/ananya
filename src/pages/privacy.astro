      <h1>Privacy Policy.</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 2024.</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction.</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Persephone ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our AI chat service.
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices.
        By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect.</h2>
      <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Address.</strong> We collect and hash your IP address for rate limiting purposes and to maintain session continuity.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat Messages.</strong> We temporarily store your chat messages and AI responses to provide conversation context and chat history functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data.</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the Service, including timestamps and selected modes.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data.</strong> We may collect browser type, device information, and other technical data for analytics and service improvement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information.</h2>
      <p>We use collected information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
        <li>To enforce rate limits and prevent abuse.</li>
        <li>To provide conversation context and chat history.</li>
        <li>To improve and optimize the Service.</li>
        <li>To monitor for security threats and violations of our Terms.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Retention.</h2>
      <p>
        Chat history and session data are retained for 24 hours and then automatically deleted.
        IP address hashes are retained only for rate limiting purposes and reset daily.
        We do not permanently store your conversations or personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security.</h2>
      <p>
        We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data.
        IP addresses are hashed before storage to protect your identity.
        All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS.
        However, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Services.</h2>
      <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking.</h2>
      <p>
        We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.
        Session identification is based on IP address hashing.
        We may use essential cookies for service functionality if required.
